Q1:
Very clear and informative data exploration plots.
In my opinion, it is better to reduce some of the spaces between bars. 
Next time it is better to add explanation to the notebook itself - this is one of the biggest advantages of notebooks.

Q2:
Good answer overall.
I would expect to mention your conclusion about the learning process - why in some cases the learning process stops after few iterations? All the iteration are necessary?

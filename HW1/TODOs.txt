Popularity-based model:
 1. Take the "ratings" matrix
 2. Create a "predictions" matrix where every rating for a movie is its average:
     - For EVERY user we predict the rating to item X as X's average rating (from "ratings", but not including the 0 ratings!)
 3. Calculate RMSE, MRR, nDCG
 4. Plot and add to the Word document! (you can easily see how I implemeted it to each metric with the SGD, ALS and Bias-only models)
 
 5. SUBMIT!!! (main notebook ipynb and Word document) - "Zip file including Jupyter notebook file and images"
